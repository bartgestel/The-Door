    "prompt": "Create a Shader Graph for a laser beam effect. The shader should use an unlit base, with emissive glow and transparency. Add additive blending for a glowing effect. Include a scrolling texture feature to simulate movement along the beam. The shader should support a color property to adjust the beam's color and an alpha property to control transparency. Ensure the surface type is set to transparent and the blend mode is additive.",
